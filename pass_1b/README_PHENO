We provide the phenotypic and biospecimen metadata in a single large table called merged_dmaqc_data.  It has a row for each vial label (the main sample id). Thus, animal/specimen with a labelid but without vials are not represented here. 

We also provide the dictionary of the columns (the data fields) in merged_dmaqc_dict.txt. Row j in this table provides information about the field in column j of merged_dmaqc_data.

Except for viallabel, labelid, pid, and bid the column format is:
"w1.w2", where:
w1 the column type, which is largely the form from which it was taken (e.g., Registration)
w2 is the feature/field name (e.g., sex)

Notable useful columns are:
  viallabel - can be used to map molecular data to the phenotypic metadata
  labelid,bid,pid - higher level ids (order is pid,bid,labelid,vialabel)
  Registration.sex,
  Registration.weight,
  VO2.Max.Test.vo2_max - the VO2 score
  Fields that start with "Key" provide information about the randomization group (e.g., Key.ANIRandGroup)
  Fields that start with "calculated.variables": weight and sample time calculated features (e.g., sample freeze time)
